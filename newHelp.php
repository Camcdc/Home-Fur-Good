            <h1>How to Help</h1>
            <p class="intro-text">At the SPCA, every act of support helps us continue our vital work in caring for animals in need. We offer a variety of ways for you to get involvedâ€”whether through a direct donation, sponsoring specific expenses, or even by volunteering your time. Each contribution, big or small, makes a real difference in the lives of our animals and the community we serve. Consider the following ways you can help and be a part of our mission:</p>
            
            <div class="image-placeholder">

            </div>
            
            <p>Your financial support is the cornerstone of our ability to provide comprehensive care for animals in need. Every donation, regardless of size, directly impacts the lives of vulnerable animals in our community. Your generosity enables us to provide essential medical treatment, nutritious food, safe shelter, and behavioral rehabilitation for animals who have been abandoned, abused, or neglected.</p>
            
            <p>When you donate to the SPCA Grahamstown, you're not just giving money â€“ you're giving hope. You're funding life-saving surgeries, providing warm bedding for a frightened puppy, ensuring that no animal goes hungry, and supporting our dedicated staff who work tirelessly to give every animal the care they deserve.</p>

Every adoption saves two lives â€“ the one you adopt and the one that takes their place in our shelter. Our animals come from various backgrounds, but they all share one thing in common: they're ready to love and be loved.</p>
            
            <p>Our adoption process is designed to ensure the best match between you and your new companion. We provide comprehensive information about each animal's personality, medical history, and specific needs to help you make an informed decision. Our team is here to support you every step of the way, from initial meeting to successful integration into your home.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>The Grahamstown SPCA (Makhanda) was founded in 1958 and registered as a Non-Profit Organization (NPO no. 035-579) in 2004. The Society is a non-governmental organization and relies entirely on the financial support of concerned individuals and businesses, as well as income from our Charity Shop and other fundraising activities, to sustain our operational and outreach needs.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Society does not receive any funding from the South African Government or the local Municipality, making community support absolutely essential to our continued operation. We are managed by a dedicated Management Committee who volunteer their time and expertise to ensure effective governance and strategic direction.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our professional staff are employed to run the Kennels, conduct Inspectorate work, and operate the Charity Shop. We warmly welcome volunteers at both the Kennels and the Charity Shop, as they are integral to our daily operations and the quality of care we can provide.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Society is proudly affiliated with the NSPCA and operates in full compliance with the rules and standards of the SPCA movement, ensuring that we maintain the highest standards of animal welfare and professional conduct.</p>
